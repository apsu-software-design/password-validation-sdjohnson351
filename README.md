# Credit

All credit goes to the University of Wisconsin for the format of this homework assignment and the survey questions below.

# Setup and Review

This repo contains code for the password validator. The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

## Did you find the JavaScript Learning Tutor useful? If so, what about the tool made it useful? If not, why not?
> I did not get the link to it until after I finished, but I was able to teach myself as much javaScript as I needed in order to make it work.


## Do you have any suggestions on how the JavaScript Learning Tutor might be improved?
> Since I did not use it, I cannot say.


## Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!).
> https://www.codecademy.com/articles/getting-user-input-in-node-js
> https://nodejs.dev/learn/accept-input-from-the-command-line-in-nodejs
> Since the Learning Tutor was not up, I used these to learn how to take input.


## Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment?
> 6, most of that time was learning JavaScript.


## On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment?
> 7, probably would be easier if I had had the tutorial.


## Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better?
> I basically have never used the command line directly so I did not know where I was supposed to be doing the commands or what even I was supposed to do.
> Also, I added a special character requirement to the password validation javaScript just to see if I could, it just needs to be uncommented.
